- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlebrtEnstien
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything and everything in the theoretical physics and all branches of math. I also have an interest in technology which is why i am here
- 🌱 I’m currently learning calculus and different ways that things crash and glitch
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything legal
- 📫 How to reach me: well I can't tell you that until I learn who you are, because I want to be on the safe side and not get hacked. No offense meant, I am just taking precautions.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/Personhead of a pear
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am literally in 6th grade and learning calculus and precalculus.
I have one finding to publish: If you are on a school chromebook which does not allow multiple sign in which is 122 or higher, I found something interesting. Log out. TURN off the internet, and open secure test or NWEA browsers, and sign in as an existing user, it will simply stop you from doing anything and tell you multiple sign in is disabled. Open chrome vox with ctrl alt z, and do launcher+period then click the gear shaped button next to the x, and it brings you to the blocked or unblocked dino game page or no internet screen, bypassing the pop up.
