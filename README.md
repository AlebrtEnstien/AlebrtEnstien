- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlebrtEnstien
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything and everything in the theoretical physics and all branches of math. I also have an interest in technology which is why i am here
- 🌱 I’m currently learning calculus and different ways that things crash and glitch
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything legal
- 📫 How to reach me: well I can't tell you that until I learn who you are, because I want to be on the safe side and not get hacked. No offense meant, I am just taking precautions.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/Personhead of a pear
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am literally in 6th grade and learning calculus and precalculus.
